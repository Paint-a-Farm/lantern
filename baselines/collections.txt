# 10/15 files passing, 159/167 functions (95.2%)
#
# Remaining failures (analyzed, not fixable without major refactoring):
#   BaseStateMachineState fn#14: Move:-1 (register allocation)
#   TestPolygon fn#1: Move:-2 (register allocation)
#   ValueDelay fn#1: Jump:-2 (compiler version routing blocks)
#   DynamicDataGrid fn#11: many (bool value → truthiness chain merging)
#   Polygon2D fn#13: many (cross-register value ternary)
